WyvernMC is the development group for the two Minecraft servers [Wyvern Cove](https://www.wyverncove.com/) and [Wyvern PvP](https://www.pvpwyvern.com/). 


## The Wyvern Cove Experience

The perfect balance of a semi-vanilla survival server, and the only one you'll ever need to join. We're about to bring you one of the best survival experiences possible in the stunning world of Minecraft. Team up, build, fight, grief, trade, build alliances, form enemies, and so much more... The opportunities here are endless!

## The Wyvern PvP Experience

PvP should be easy, and finding a good training server should be too. With  Wyvern PvP, you can easily create custom kits, choose your set gamemodes, join an FFA, team up with a partner, and the list goes on...
